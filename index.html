    <h1>MY EXPERIENCE IN EXPLORETORY WEB DESIGN </h1> <p>So this is my first experience in web design. i never took this class before, and to think i would have some kind of cool teacher such as this teacher mr pieare. i think its pretty simple to do this css and html it was pretty fun because i made a bunch of time in this class i may not be the best at this class but at least i try my best in this cte class but mind you. im not as good as everyone else but i try in classes like this. tjis class was not that hard in the first few days but as we progressed in the days, the assigments started getting a bit harder
